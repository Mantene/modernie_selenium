Manage modern.ie VirtualBox-Appliances with Selenium-Support

This script allows to delete and create virtual Windows-Machines using Images from http://www.modern.ie for automating Browser-Testing with Selenium.

As the modern.ie-Machines refuses to run more than 30-90 Days (at least for more than an hour) we remove the machines on a regular basis and recreate the original Appliance with all changes needed to run Selenium.
